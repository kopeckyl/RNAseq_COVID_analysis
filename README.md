# RNAseq_COVID_analysis
This Repository shows my analysis comparing expression of SARS and COVID-19

# Main purpose

This analysis was done as a Bioinformatics course at the University of Illinois. The goal of this project was to apply an RNA-seq analysis to compare
the expression patterns between SARS and COVID-19. We also applied a simple machine learning algothim to differentiate the diseases based on expression profile.

# People involved
